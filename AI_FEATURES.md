# AI-Powered Plan Suggestions

The Keeps app now includes intelligent plan suggestions powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model!

## üöÄ How It Works

The AI analyzes your memories about your partner to suggest personalized date ideas and thoughtful gestures. It considers:

- **Memory patterns** - What they like, love, and enjoy
- **Love languages** - How they prefer to give and receive affection  
- **Recent trends** - What you've noticed about them lately
- **Location** - Local suggestions based on your current location
- **Budget and time** - Realistic options that fit your lifestyle

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. **Get an OpenAI API Key**:
   - Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create an account and generate an API key
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

2. **Configure Environment**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Add your API key:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
     ```

3. **Restart the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
