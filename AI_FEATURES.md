# AI-Powered Plan Suggestions

The Keeps app features an advanced AI algorithm that requires **7+ memories** to generate deeply personalized plan suggestions using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model!

## üß† Core Algorithm - The 7+ Memory Requirement

**Why 7 memories?** Our AI needs substantial data to understand your partner's unique personality, preferences, and patterns. With fewer memories, suggestions would be generic. With 7+ memories, the AI can:

- **Identify deep patterns** across all your memories, not just recent ones
- **Extract emotional keywords** and relationship insights
- **Understand seasonal and temporal preferences**
- **Create highly personalized suggestions** with 70%+ confidence scores

## üöÄ Enhanced Analysis Process

The AI performs comprehensive analysis of ALL your memories to identify:

- **Memory patterns** - Recurring themes, preferences, and interests
- **Emotional insights** - How your partner responds to different experiences
- **Activity preferences** - Specific types of activities they enjoy
- **Temporal patterns** - Seasonal preferences and timing insights
- **Local opportunities** - Nearby businesses and venues that match their interests
- **Relationship dynamics** - Communication style and attention to detail

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. **Get an OpenAI API Key**:
   - Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
